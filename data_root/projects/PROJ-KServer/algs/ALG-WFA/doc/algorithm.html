    The Work Function algorithm (WFA) is a dynamic programming method which is one of the best on line solutions to the k-server problem. It is fairly complex but in short the algorithm when choosing the server for servicing takes into account the current distance (similar to the Greedy solution) and the entire history of past requests. The algorithm tries to adapt it's choices to past requests in the hope that they will repeat themselves. The main edge it has over the Greedy solution is therefore that it searches for patterns and remembers the past. Consequentially it performs badly when there are no patterns such as in a completely random scenario.
