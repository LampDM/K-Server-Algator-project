    The algorithm looks exclusively at the current configuration of servers and the incoming request. It therefore has no memory of the past and is  the simplest algorithm. It tries to find the server that is closest to the incoming request and moves it to it. The time complexity of the algorithm is O(k * r) where k is the number of servers and r the number of requests.
