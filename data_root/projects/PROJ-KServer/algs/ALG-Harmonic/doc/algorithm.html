    The algorithm is similar to Greedy with one key difference. In contrast to the Greedy algorithm that always services the current request with the closest server the Harmonic algorithm choses any of the servers for servicing with a probability that is inversely proportional to the distance between the server and request. Let A be the location of the current request. The normalization factor in this case is N = Î£z d(A,z) where z takes on the value of all the servers. A server on location x therefore services a location A with probability 1/(N * d(A,x)) where d is a function giving the distance between two points. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(k * r) just like the Greedy one with slightly more calculation operations in each step.
