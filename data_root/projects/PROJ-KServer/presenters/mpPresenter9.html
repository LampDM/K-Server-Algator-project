    This presenter presents the changes in the performance of the Harmonic algorithm given an increase in dimensions with a base case of 2 servers and 185 requests. The dimensions range from 11 (1) to 11x11 (3) and to 11x11x11x11x11x11x11 (7) with each series of 12 tests representing one dimension going from 1D to 7D.
